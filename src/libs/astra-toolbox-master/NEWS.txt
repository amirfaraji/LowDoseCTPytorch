1.9.0 (2018-??-??)
  * add 2D parallel_vec geometry
      The old ExtraDetectorOffset option has been removed. Please use
      parallel_vec to achieve this effect now
  * fix inconsistent rotation direction in CPU fan beam code
  * fix scaling of output values for FDK and fan beam FBP in some geometries

1.8.3 (2017-11-06)
  * fix geometry memory leak in 3D FP/BP
  * fix FDK short scan weighting
  * add preliminary support for building on macOS
  * add experimental support for using externally managed GPU memory from python
    (see samples/python/s021_pygpu.py)
  * our Linux conda python packages now have variants depending on the
    cudatoolkit version
  * add basic post-install tests test_CUDA/test_noCUDA (see README)

1.8 (2016-12-05)
  * the Windows binary release now requires CUDA 8.0
  * major changes to the way 'make install' works when building from source
  * removed GPU memory size restrictions for FDK
  * added multi-GPU support to 3D FP/BP/FDK
  * added relaxation factor option to SIRT, SART
  * fixed certain projections parallel to XZ or YZ planes
  * fixed accumulating multiple raylengths in SART
  * for matlab OpTomo, make output type match input type
  * for python OpTomo, add FP/BP functions with optional 'out' argument
  * fixed problems with non-US locales

1.7.1beta (2015-12-23)
  * NB: This release has a beta tag as it contains two new
    big experimental features.
  * fix crash with certain 2D CUDA FP calls

1.7beta (2015-12-04)
  * NB: This release has a beta tag as it contains two new
    big experimental features.
  * experimental MPI distributed computing support in Python
  * experimental support in Python for FP and BP of objects
    composited from multiple 3d data objects, at possibly different resolutions.
    This also removes some restrictions on data size for 3D GPU FP and BP.
  * support for Python algorithm plugins
  * removed restrictions on volume geometries:
        The volume no longer has to be centered.
        Voxels still have to be cubes, but no longer 1x1x1.
  * build fixes for newer platforms
  * various consistency and bug fixes

1.6 (2015-05-29)
  * integrate and improve python interface
  * integrate opSpot-based opTomo operator
  * build fixes for newer platforms
  * various consistency and bug fixes

1.5 (2015-01-30)
  * add support for fan beam FBP
  * remove limits on number of angles in GPU code
    (They are still limited by available memory, however)
  * update the included version of the DART algorithm
  * build fixes for newer platforms
  * various consistency and bug fixes

1.4 (2014-04-07)
  * various consistency and bug fixes
  * add global astra_set_gpu_index

1.3 (2013-07-02)
  * various consistency and bug fixes
  * add a version of the DART algorithm (written by Wim van Aarle)

1.2 (2013-03-01)
  * various consistency and bug fixes

1.1 (2012-10-24)
  * add support for matlab single arrays in mex interface

1.0 (2012-08-22)
  * first public release
