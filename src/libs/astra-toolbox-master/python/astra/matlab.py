"""This module implements a MATLAB-like interface to the ASTRA Toolbox.

Note that all functions are called with a :class:`string` as the first
argument, specifying the operation to perform. This un-pythonic way
is used to make transitioning from MATLAB code to Python code easier, as
the MATLAB interface uses the same type of method calling.

After an initial ``import astra``, these functions can be accessed in the
``astra.m`` module.
